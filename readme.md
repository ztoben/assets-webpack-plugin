Webpack plugin that emits a json file with assets paths.

## Why is this useful?

When working with Webpack you might want to generate your bundles with a generated hash in them (for cache busting).

This plug-in outputs a json file with the paths of the generated assets so you can find them from somewhere else.

### Example output:

The output is a JSON object in the form:

```json
{
    "bundle_name": {
        "asset_kind": "/public/path/to/asset"
    }
}
```

Where:

    * `"bundle_name"` is the name of the bundle (the key of the entry object in your webpack config, or "main" if your entry is an array).
    * `"asset_kind"` is the camel-cased file extension of the asset, except for source maps where `asset_kind = camelcase(file_xtension) + 'SourceMap'`.

For example, given the following webpack config:

```js
{
    entry: {
        one: ['src/one.js'],
        two: ['src/two.js']
    },
    output: {
        path: path.join(__dirname, "public", "js"),
        publicPath: "/js/",
        filename: '[name]_[hash].bundle.js',
        sourceMapFilename: '[file].map'
    }
}
```

The plugin will output the following json file:

```json
{
    "one": {
        "js": "/js/one_2bb80372ebe8047a68d4.bundle.js",
        "jsSourceMap": "/js/one_2bb80372ebe8047a68d4.bundle.js.map"
    },
    "two": {
        "js": "/js/two_2bb80372ebe8047a68d4.bundle.js",
        "jsSourceMap": "/js/two_2bb80372ebe8047a68d4.bundle.js.map"
    }
}
```

## Install

```sh
npm install assets-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

## Configuration

In your webpack config include the plug-in. And add it to your config:

```js
var path = require('path');
var AssetsPlugin = require('assets-webpack-plugin');
var assetsPluginInstance = new AssetsPlugin();

module.exports = {
    // ...
    output: {
        path: path.join(__dirname, "public", "js"),
        filename: "[name]-bundle-[hash].js",
        publicPath: "/js/"
    },
    // ....
    plugins: [assetsPluginInstance]
};
```

### Options

You can pass the following options:

__path__: 

Path where to save the created json file. Defaults to the current directory.

```js
new AssetsPlugin({path: path.join(__dirname, 'app', 'views')})
```

__filename__: 

Name for the created json file. Defaults to `webpack-assets.json`

```js
new AssetsPlugin({filename: 'assets.json'})
```

### Using this with Rails

You can use this with Rails to find the bundled Webpack assets via sprockets. In `ApplicationController` you might have:

```ruby
def script_for(bundle)
  path = Rails.root.join('app', 'views', 'webpack-assets.json') # This is the file generated by the plug-in
  file = File.read(path)
  json = JSON.parse(file)
  json[bundle]['js']
end
```

Then in the actions:

```ruby
def show
  @script = script_for('clients') # this will retrieve the bundle named 'clients'
end
```

And finally in the views:

```erb
<div id="app">
  <script src="<%= @script %>"></script>
</div>
```

## Test

```sh
npm test
```
